# pong
the famous two player game pong

the plan is to make it modular by using a client-server architecture where the clients are able to connect to the server via network sockets
and having a viewer that connects to the server which then is able to stream the game.
the end goal is, to be able to have two agents that can play each other and learn from their matches, with the option to tune in and watch them play.
